# WC Challenge - GoLang

## Work done:

1. Setup repos
2. Implemented CLI
3. Added (e2e) jest tests
4. Attempted to add TS but it'll require a build/compile step which isn't worth it?
5. Attempted to divide into units but again isn't worth it.
6. Tried adding a man page, but it requires manual install so not worth it
